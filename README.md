## Description

In this assignment, we built a back-end social network application where user's had displayed thoughts and could have other users as friends. NoSQL and MongoDB were used for database management. 
This project has no front end, so all routes will be tested through Insomnia.

## Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is required to run this application. Between v16 and v18 is recommended.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is required to run this application.

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) is used to test all of the routes.

The following commands were done via terminal:

- `npm i express` is used to build the server.
- `npm i mongoose` connects to the MongoDB.

## Usage

The user types `npm run seed` to seed the database, and `npm run start` to start the server. Then all routes are tested in Insomnia.
